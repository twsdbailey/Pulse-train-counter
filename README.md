# Pulse-wave-counter
Basic pulse waver counter that can be adapted and scaled as a tachometer, or low speed frequency counter

This is a general purpose counter that can be used count pulses up to 3.6kHz. The example code is a frequency counter that counts
pulses in a square wave pulse train, and displays the frequency in Hertz in the serial monitor.  This code can also be scaled to read
pulses per minute, which is useful for creating a tachometer used to measure the rotational speed of a shaft.
